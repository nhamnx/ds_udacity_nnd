## Introduction
The phrase “Work From Home” or “WFH” in short, refers to a worker who carries out their duties at home rather than in an office setting. This can be permanent as part of a home or hybrid working structure, or it might be transient as was the case during the COVID-19 epidemic.

Stack Overflow Data — 2017 Survey contains about 150 survey questions which were answered by participants in about 200 different countries. In this article, I performed some analysis on the Stack Overflow Data — 2017 Survey to answer three questions about WFH.
